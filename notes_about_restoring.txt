rewriting data without deleting db and needing to reset permissions and all that stuff

pg_dump ufo_sightings > dumpfile.db

-- edit file
-- delete all table creations
-- delete all references to id_seq
-- delete revoke/permissions at the bottom of the file

-- run on database (need to do from stage):
-- psql -h demo.server.com -U username ufo_sightings
delete from sightings where id is not null;
delete from cities where id is not null;
delete from counties where id is not null;
delete from states where id is not null;

drop sequence sightings_id_seq cascade;
drop sequence cities_id_seq cascade;
drop sequence counties_id_seq cascade;
drop sequence states_id_seq cascade;

-- run this a couple of times to get the cascades
ALTER TABLE ONLY cities DROP CONSTRAINT cities_pkey;
ALTER TABLE ONLY counties DROP CONSTRAINT counties_pkey;
ALTER TABLE ONLY sightings DROP CONSTRAINT sightings_pkey;
ALTER TABLE ONLY states DROP CONSTRAINT states_pkey;
ALTER TABLE ONLY sightings DROP CONSTRAINT fk_city;
ALTER TABLE ONLY cities DROP CONSTRAINT fk_county;
ALTER TABLE ONLY counties DROP CONSTRAINT fk_state;
ALTER TABLE ONLY cities DROP CONSTRAINT fk_state;

-- psql -h demo.server.com -U username ufo_sightings < dumpfile.db
